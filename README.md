## Inspiration
The UN has stated that we only have 12 years to limit the scope of an inevitable climate change catastrophe.

Sparked by unchecked industrial waste and exploitation of resources, climate change is happening faster than our planet can adapt to it. Is this the future you want?

## What it does
TerraformAR lets you experience this disastrous future we are headed towards and then offers an AR tool to make this problem visible today so disaster isn't our destiny.

TerraformAR gives form to hidden layers of our ecology as an AR overlay. See the state of the environment around you; including air quality, annual climate change, pollution, land development, water quality, and health of flora and fauna.

## How we built it
There are two parts to TerraformAR, the first is a 60 second WebVR intro experience that shows future downtown NYC. This VR experience was built in Unity and exported to the web. Kat used a mixture of her own modeling and premade assets to build and animate this scene. The second part of TerraformAR is a WebAR overlay powered by custom JavaScript code on top of AFrame and Three.js. This custom code is designed to create an WebAR overlay compatible with any smartphone made in the last 5 years. (I.E. not needing WebXR support to display AR in the browser.

## Challenges we ran into
To make an easy to use AR overlay available to everyone, we had to make a new type of WebAR framework. This took some serious experimenting to get right. 

We also had to source mapping, data and assets that all fit into our concept.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We built a new type of WebAR overlay!

The future NYC experience looks like rad dreamscape and evokes tons of emotion.

## What we learned
Because of all of our limited experience in WebXR tech, we all had to learn how to mesh our skills and learn as we built.

## What's next for TerraformAR
We hope to mature the AR and VR portions of the experience and to publish the WebAR overlay as an AFrame component.
